## Capstone Project on Home Credit Default Risk Prediction.

This collaborative capstone project, accomplished by a team of four students from the University of Utah (David Eccles Business School), centers around forecasting the creditworthiness of loan applicants and their repayment capacity. Utilizing a dataset from Home Credit, encompassing telco and transactional data, the team employed exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to construct predictive models.

## Business Problem:

Since many prospective borrowers lack established credit histories, loans are unfairly withheld from them. By offering loans to these people, Home Credit hopes to address this issue, but it is difficult to determine with any degree of certainty how well they can be expected to return the loans. The business problem can be summarized as: How can Home Credit make sure that deserving customers with weak or no credit histories are not denied loans and that loans are designed to provide customers the best chance of successfully repaying them?
